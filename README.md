KeepClone: A Keep Notes App Clone
KeepClone is a project aimed at replicating the functionality of Google's Keep Notes app using Dart and Flutter, with additional features implemented through SQFLITE and Firebase. This project provides users with a platform to create, organize, and manage their notes efficiently.

Features:
Sticky Notes with Color Feature: Users can create colorful sticky notes to organize their thoughts, tasks, and reminders conveniently.
Google Account Sign-In: Integration with Google account sign-in allows users to access their notes across multiple devices and ensures data security.
Archived Notes Feature: KeepClone enables users to archive notes they no longer need immediate access to, keeping their workspace clutter-free.
CRUD Operations: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality is implemented, giving users complete control over their notes.
Searching Functionality: Users can easily search through their notes using keywords, titles, or tags, facilitating quick access to specific information.
Firebase Integration: Firebase is utilized for real-time synchronization of notes across devices, ensuring seamless user experience and data consistency.
Technologies Used:
Dart: Primary programming language used for building the app logic.
Flutter: Framework used for developing the cross-platform user interface.
SQFLITE: Local database for storing notes data locally on the device.
Firebase: Cloud-based backend service for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
